## Our Elevator Pitch!
Today, we’re going to be joining our friend Arjun on a financial journey. Arjun is a recent CS grad, has just gotten a job as a software developer, getting paid about 75k a year. Arjun isn’t a big numbers guy, but knows that if he invests right he can accumulate his wealth fast - he’s even heard from some Youtube video he can’t remember that he could become a millionaire by age 40. 

Yet there’s one thing people like Arjun tend to forget.

Put your money where your mouth is. On the side, Arjun attends all the climate strikes, he recycles extensively. But when Arjun invests in mutual funds, he doesn’t know that his money’s going straight to the fossil fuel industry. 
 
We built a web-based software solution from the ground up for anyone like Arjun, to break down personal finances and investing, and to offer him ‘green’ investment options like top rated ETF’s and mutual funds, so that Arjun is investing in both his future - and the planet’s.
